- Music has always played an important throughout my life - and that was especially true during my presidency.
While reviewing my notes ahead of debeates. I'd listen to Jay-Z's "My 1st Song" or Frank Sinatra's "Luck be a Lady". throughout our time in the while house, Michelle and I invited artist like Stevie Wonder and Gloria to conduct afternoon workshops with young people before performing an evening show in the East Room. And there were all sorts of performances. I'll  always remember - like Beyonce performing "At last" for our first dance at our inauguaration, Paul McCartney serencading Michelle in the East Room with "Michele" and Bob Dylan flashing me a grin before vanishing after his performance of "Times they are a Changin". So in honor of my book coming out tomorrow, I throug I'd put together playlist with some of those songs. Hope you enjoy it

- Part of my goal in writting A Promised Land was to share my expensive as President in promoting and advancing our shared international goals like increased freedom, human rights, and a mutual understanding of one another. For a long time, in many parts of the world, we have been on a trajectory of progress in these areas. But we have got to realize the democracy, better educational attainment and rising prospects, especially for women-these things are not predestined. So I also wanted the book to be a call to all those who say that these are values and ideals worth fighting for; a reminder of what it takes to protect and further the gains we've made around the world
