Music has always played an important throughout my life - and that was especially true during my presidency.
While reviewing my notes ahead of debeates. I'd listen to Jay-Z's "My 1st Song" or Frank Sinatra's "Luck be a Lady". throughout our time in the while house, Michelle and I invited artist like Stevie Wonder and Gloria to conduct afternoon workshops with young people before performing an evening show in the East Room. And there were all sorts of performances. I'll  always remember - like Beyonce performing "At last" for our first dance at our inauguaration, Paul McCartney serencading Michelle in the East Room with "Michele" and Bob Dylan flashing me a grin before vanishing after his performance of "Times they are a Changin". So in honor of my book coming out tomorrow, I throug I'd put together playlist with some of those songs. Hope you enjoy it
