# Making a Reservation
It is not common to go to a hotel without a reservation so I will only cover the reservation aspet. Along with reserving a room, I will cover checking in, checking out, room service, and wake up call
Making a Reservation
When you make a reservation, call them and tell them you want a reservation a room. Or you can start by asking for a price
"hi, how much are your room?"
"hi what are your rates?"
"Hello, how much is a room?"
"Our room start at 79$ for a basic room."
"Our room start ar 79$ for standard room and go up to 300$ for a suite"
"Ok. Can I reserve a room?"
"hi I would like reserved a room"
"Hello Can I reseve a couple of room?"

The first thing they usually ask is the dates you want the room and the duration.
"What day do you want to check in?"
"Which date did you want to reserve?"
"What date are you looking for"
"I want a room from june 22nd to june 25th"
"I would like a room for the 19th of july"
"How long will you be staying with us"
"When will you be checking out?"
"How many days would you like the room for?"
"I am going to stay for 3 days."
"I would like to reserve the room for 4 days."
"I am going to need the room until July 23rd"
The next series of questions covers how many people and how many rooms. Some hotels charge by number of room only
"How many rooms will you need?"
"Is this for one room?"
"How many rooms would you like to reserve?"
"How many rooms should I reserve for you?"
"I will only need one room"
"I am going to need two rooms"
"How many adults will be in your party"
"How many total children will be with you"
"Just two adults"
"A total of four adults"
"I will be alone"
"A total of 2 adults and 2 children"
"One adult and 2 children"
After ther detemine how many rooms and how many total people, they wil ask you what type of bed you want
"Would you like a single king size of bed, or two double size of beds in the room?"
"Will a single king size bed is ok?"
"We only have two room with two double size of beds. Wil that be ok?"
"Do you want a smoking room or non smoking room?"
"Do you prefer a smoking room or non smoking room?"
"I would like a smoking room"
"Can I have a smoking room"
"Either is fine"
"I don't have a preference"
You will have to provide your credit card number to reserve the room
"Can I get a credit card number"
"Can I get your credit card number"
"What is your credit card number"
Finally, they will repeat all information back to you
"Ok Mr. Hanh. I have one smoking room reserved for 19th till july 22nd. The total comes to $256 after tax. If you need to cancel, please call us 24 hours before july 19th. Can I help you with anything else?"
