Dai: Hello, Did you want to see me?
Dung: Yes Dai please come in. I hope I didn't interrupt you from work.
Dai: no it's fine. I was just on break.
Dung: Not at all, I just wanted you to take a quick survey for me.
Dai: Survey? What's kind of survey?
Dung: Dai, I heard about the incident the other day. So I just want you to respond to a few questions from my questionaire.
